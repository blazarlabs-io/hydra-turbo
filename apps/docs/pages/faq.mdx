# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about Blazar Pay and the Blazar Terminal.

## General Questions

### What is Blazar Pay?

Blazar Pay is a comprehensive micropayments ecosystem built on Cardano blockchain technology. It consists of payment terminals, merchant applications, mobile wallets, and backend services that enable fast, secure, and low-cost micropayments.

### What is the Blazar Terminal?

The Blazar Terminal is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) payment terminal that enables contactless micropayments. It runs on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W hardware and communicates with mobile devices via BLE and with merchant applications via WebSocket.

### How does Blazar Pay work?

Blazar Pay enables micropayments through a multi-component system:
1. **Blazar Terminal**: Hardware device that advertises payment requests via BLE
2. **Mobile App**: Connects to terminals and processes payments
3. **Merchant App**: Manages terminals and receives payment confirmations
4. **Backend**: Processes payments on Cardano L2 and manages transactions

## Hardware Questions

### What hardware does the Blazar Terminal use?

The Blazar Terminal is built on **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** with:
- ARM Cortex-A53 quad-core 64-bit processor @ 1.0GHz
- 512MB LPDDR4 SDRAM
- Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4GHz)
- Bluetooth 4.2 + BLE 4.2
- microSD card storage (8GB+ recommended)

### Can I use a different Raspberry Pi model?

The Blazar Terminal is optimized for Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. While it may work on other Pi models, we recommend using the specified hardware for optimal performance and compatibility.

### What are the power requirements?

The Blazar Terminal requires:
- **Input**: 5V/2.5A via microUSB
- **Consumption**: ~2.5W active, ~1.5W idle
- **UPS Support**: Recommended for critical deployments

## Software Questions

### What operating system does the Blazar Terminal use?

The Blazar Terminal runs **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** for optimal performance and minimal resource usage.

### What Node.js version is required?

The Blazar Terminal requires **Node.js 16.x or higher**, with **Node.js 18.x LTS** recommended.

### What are the main software dependencies?

The core dependencies are:
- **bleno**: BLE peripheral library (@abandonware/bleno@^0.6.2)
- **express**: Web framework (^5.1.0)
- **socket.io**: Real-time communication (^4.8.1)

## BLE Questions

### What BLE service does the Blazar Terminal use?

The Blazar Terminal uses service UUID: `1d4ddcb2-279d-42e2-a95a-274352a25248`

### How does BLE communication work?

The Blazar Terminal exposes four BLE characteristics:
1. **Merchant Address** (Read): Contains the merchant's Cardano address
2. **Payment Amount** (Read): Payment amount in smallest unit
3. **Asset Unit** (Read): Asset identifier (lovelace or custom asset)
4. **Client Address** (Read/Write): Client's Cardano address for authorization

### What is the BLE range?

The typical BLE range is **~10 meters** indoors, though this can vary based on environmental factors and interference.

## Payment Questions

### What cryptocurrencies are supported?

Blazar Pay currently supports:
- **ADA** (Cardano native token)
- **Custom Cardano assets** (tokens created on Cardano)

### How fast are payments processed?

Payments are processed in **< 5 seconds end-to-end**, including:
- BLE communication
- Blockchain verification
- Confirmation delivery

### What are the transaction fees?

Transaction fees are minimal due to Cardano L2 integration:
- **Network fees**: ~0.17 ADA per transaction
- **Platform fees**: Variable based on merchant agreement
- **No additional BLE or WebSocket fees**

### Can I process refunds?

Yes, refunds can be processed through the merchant application. The backend APIs support refund operations with proper authorization.

## Integration Questions

### How do I integrate with my existing POS system?

Integration is done through the WebSocket API:
1. Connect to the Blazar Terminal WebSocket server (port 3000)
2. Send `requestFunds` events to initiate payments
3. Receive `payed` events for payment confirmations

### Can I use multiple terminals?

Yes, you can manage multiple Blazar Terminals from a single merchant application. Each terminal has a unique identifier and can be configured independently.

### Is there a mobile SDK available?

Mobile SDKs are available for:
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **iOS**: Native Swift/Objective-C
- **Android**: Native Kotlin/Java
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform development

## Security Questions

### Is BLE communication encrypted?

BLE communication is not encrypted by default. For production use, we recommend implementing additional encryption layers and using secure communication channels.

### How are private keys managed?

Private keys are managed by the mobile wallet applications and are never transmitted to the Blazar Terminal. The terminal only receives public addresses for payment processing.

### What security measures are in place?

Security measures include:
- **Input validation** for all payment parameters
- **Rate limiting** for API requests
- **Audit logging** for all transactions
- **HTTPS** for API communications
- **Biometric authentication** in mobile apps

## Troubleshooting Questions

### The terminal is not discoverable by mobile devices

Try these solutions:
1. Check if Bluetooth is enabled: `sudo systemctl status bluetooth`
2. Restart Bluetooth service: `sudo systemctl restart bluetooth`
3. Verify BLE capabilities: `sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(which node)`

### WebSocket connection fails

Check these items:
1. Verify port 3000 is available: `netstat -tulpn | grep :3000`
2. Check firewall settings: `sudo ufw status`
3. Test WebSocket server: `curl -I http://localhost:3000`

### API connection fails

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Test API connectivity: `curl -I https://api.blazarpay.com`
2. Check network connection: `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8`
3. Verify API_BASE_URL in configuration

### Payment processing fails

Common causes and solutions:
1. **Insufficient funds**: Verify client wallet balance
2. **Network issues**: Check internet connectivity
3. **API errors**: Review API response logs
4. **BLE timeout**: Ensure devices are within range

## Development Questions

### Can I modify the Blazar Terminal software?

Yes, the Blazar Terminal software is open source. You can modify it according to your needs, though we recommend following the existing architecture for compatibility.
