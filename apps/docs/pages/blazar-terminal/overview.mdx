# Overview

The Blazar Terminal is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) contactless payment terminal designed for the Blazar Pay micropayments system on Cardano. It serves as the bridge between mobile wallets and merchant applications, enabling secure, low-latency micropayments for both ADA and custom assets.

## Core Functionality

The Blazar Terminal operates as a BLE peripheral device that:

- **Advertises payment requests** to nearby mobile devices
- **Exposes payment details** through BLE characteristics
- **Processes payments** via integration with the Blazar API
- **Notifies merchant applications** of payment completion via WebSocket
